Hello! I'm Marcelo de Souza Ribeiro, a Computer Science student interested in game development, Virtual Reality (VR), and Data Science.

Currently, I'm exploring game development basics and experimenting with VR technologies. I'm also learning about Data Science and how to analyze and understand data effectively.

Feel free to check out my projects and get in touchâ€”I'm open to discussing ideas or collaborating.
